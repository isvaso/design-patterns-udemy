Summary.

1. Objects can use other objects via inheritance / composition;
2. Some composed and singular objects need similar / identical behaviors;
3. Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects uniformly;
4. Java supports container iteration with the Iterable<T> interface;
5. A single object can masquerade as a collection containing only this.
