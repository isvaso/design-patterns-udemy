Flyweight.
A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing
externally the data associated with similar objects.
Space optimization!

Motivation.
1. Avoid redundancy when storing data;
2. E.g., MMORPG:
   - Plenty of users with identical first / last names;
   - No sense in storing same first / last name over and over again;
   - Store a list of names and pointers of them.
3. E.g., bold or italic text in the console:
   - Don't want each character to have a formatting character;
   - Operate on rangers (e.g., line number, start / end positions).
