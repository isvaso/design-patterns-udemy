State.
A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state.
An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to
'trigger' a transition).
A formalized construct which manages state
and transitions is called a 'state machine'.

Fun with finite State Machines.

1. Consider an ordinary telephone
2. What you do with it depends on the state of the telephone/line
   - If it's ringing or you want to make a call, you can pick it up
   - Phone must be off the hook to talk/make a call
   - If you try calling someone, and it's busy, you put the handset down
3. Changes in state can be explicit or in response to event
   (Observer patter)
