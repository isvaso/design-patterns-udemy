Summary.
1. Given sufficient complexity, it pays to formally define
   possible states and events/triggers
2. Can define:
   - State entry/exit behaviors
   - Action when a particular event causes a transition
   - Guard conditions enabling/disabling a transition
   - Default action when no transitions are found for an event
