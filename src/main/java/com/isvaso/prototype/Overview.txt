Prototype.
A Partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.
When it's easier to copy an existing object to fully initialize a new one.

Motivation.
1. Complicated objects (e.g., cars) aren't designed from scratch:
   - They reiterate existing designs;
2. An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype;
3. We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it:
   - Requires 'deep copy' support;
4. We make th e cloning convenient (e.g, via a Factory).
