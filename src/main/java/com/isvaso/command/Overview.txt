Command.
An object which represents an instruction to perform a particular action.
Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken.

YOU SHALL NOT PASS!

Motivation.
1. Ordinary Java statements are perishable
   - Cannot undo a field assigment
   - Cannot directly serialize a sequence of actions (calls)
2. Want an object that represents an operation
   - X should change its field Y to value Z
   - X should do w()
3. Uses: GUI commands, multi-level undo/redo, macro recording and more!
