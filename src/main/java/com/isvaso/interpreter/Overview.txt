Interpreter.
A component that process structured text data. Does so by turning it into separate
lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing).

Motivation.
1. Textual input needs to be processed
   - E.g., turned into OOP structures
2. Some examples:
   - Programming language compilers, interpreters and IDEs
   - HTML, XML and similar
   - Numeric expressions (3+4/5)
   - Regular expressions
3. Turning strings into OOP based structures in a complicated process
