Strategy Coding Exercise
Consider the quadratic equation and its canonical solution:

ax^2 + bx + c = 0
x = (-b Â± sqrt (b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

The part b^2-4*a*c is called the discriminant.
Suppose we want to provide an API with two different strategies
for calculating the discriminant:

1. In OrdinaryDiscriminantStrategy , If the discriminant is negative,
we return it as-is. This is OK, since our main API returns Complex
numbers anyway.

2. In RealDiscriminantStrategy , if the discriminant is negative, the return
value is NaN (not a number). NaN propagates throughout the calculation,
so the equation solver gives two NaN values.
Please implement both of these strategies as well as the equation solver
itself. With regards to plus-minus in the formula, please return
the + result as the first element and - as the second.

Note: the implementation uses two classes called Pair
and Complex -- complete source for both classes is provided in the exercise.
