Strategy.
Enables the exact behavior of a system to be
selected either at run-time (dynamic) or
compile-time (static).

System behavior partially specified at runtime.


Motivation.
1. Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher-
   and lower- levers parts
2. Making tea can be decomposed into
   - The process of making a hot beverage (boil water, pour into cup); and
   - Tea-specific things (put teabag into water)
3. The high-level algorithm can then be reused
   for making coffee or hot chocolate
   - Supported by beverage-specific strategies
