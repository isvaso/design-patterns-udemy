Null Object.
A no-op object that conforms to the required
interface, satisfying a dependency requirement
of some other object.

A behavioral design pattern with no behaviors :)

Motivation.
1. When component A uses component B, it typically assumes that B is non-null
  - You inject B, not some Option<B> type
  - You do not check for null on every call
2. There is no option of felling A not to use an instance of B
   - Its use is hard-coded
3. Thus, we build a no-op, non-functioning inheritor of B
   (or some interface that B implements) and pass it into A
