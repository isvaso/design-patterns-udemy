Null Object Coding Exercise
In this example, we have a class Account
that is very tightly coupled to a Log ...
it also breaks SRP by performing all sorts
of weird checks in someOperation() .

Your mission, should you choose to accept it,
is to implement a NullLog  class that can be fed into
an Account  and that doesn't throw any exceptions.
