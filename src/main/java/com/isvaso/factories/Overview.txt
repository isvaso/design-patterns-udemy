Factory.
A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

Motivation.
1. Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
2. Constructor is not descriptive
   - Name mandated by name of containing type
   - Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names
   - Can turn into 'overloading hell'
3. Wholsesale object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsorced to
   - A separate function (Factory Method)
   - That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
   - Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory
