Summary.
1. A decorator keeps the reference to the decorated object(s);
2. May or may not forward calls:
   - IDE can Generate Delegated Members.
3. Exists in a static variation:
   - X<Y<Foo>>(/* unpleasant constructor args */)
   - Very limited dut to:
     a. Type erasure;
     b. Inability to inherit from type parameters.
