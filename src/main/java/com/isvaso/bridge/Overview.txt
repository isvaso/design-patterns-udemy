Bridge.
A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy).
Connection components together through abstraction.

Motivation.
1. Bridge prevents a 'Cartesian product' complexity explosion;
   Example:
   - Base class ThreadScheduler;
   - Can be preemptive or cooperative;
   - Can run on Windows or Unix;
   - End up with a 2x2 scenario: WindowsPTS, UnixPTS, WindowsCTS, UnixCTS
2. Bridge pattern avoids the entity explosion;
