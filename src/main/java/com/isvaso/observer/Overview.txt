Observer.
An observer is an object that wishes to
be informed about events happening in
the system. The entity generating the
events is an observable.

I am watching you!

Motivation.
1. We need yo be informed when certain things happen
   - Object's filed changes
   - Object does something
   - Some external events occurs
2. We want to listen to events and notifies when they occur
3. Typical pattern involves addXxxListener()
4. Java now has functional objects
   - Supplier<T>, Consumer<T>, Function<T>
