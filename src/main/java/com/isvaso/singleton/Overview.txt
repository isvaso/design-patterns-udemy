Singleton.
A component which is instantiated only once.
A design pattern everyone loves to hate... but is it really that bad?

"When discussing which patterns to drop, we found that we still love them all.
(Not really - I'm in  favor of dropping Singleton. Its use is almost always a design smell)."
- Erich Gamma

Motivation.
1. For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system
   - Database repository
   - Object factory
2. E.g., the constructor call is expensive
   - We only do it once
   - We provide everyone with the same instance
3. Want to prevent anyone creating additional copies
4. Need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety

PS. Dependency Injection just this idea of providing a dependency.
