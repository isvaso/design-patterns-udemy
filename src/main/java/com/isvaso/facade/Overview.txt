Overview.
Provides a simple, easy to understand / user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.
Exposing several components through a single interface.

Motivation.
1. Balancing complexity and presentation / usability;
2. Typical home:
   - Many subsystems (electrical, sanitation);
   - Complex internal structure (e.g, floor layers);
   - End user is not exposed to internals.
3. Same with software!
   - Many systems working to provide flexibility, but...
   - API consumers it to 'just work'.
