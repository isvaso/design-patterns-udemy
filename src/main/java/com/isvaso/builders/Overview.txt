Builder.
When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.

Builder Motivation:
1. Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor all;
2. Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create;
3. Having an objects with 10 constructor arguments is not productive;
4. Instead, opt for piecewise construction;
5. Builder provides an API for construction an object step-by-step.
