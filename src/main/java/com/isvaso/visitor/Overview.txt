Visitor.
A pattern where a component (visitor)
is allowed to traverse the entire
inheritance hierarchy. Implemented by
propagating a single visit() method
throughout the entire hierarchy.

Allows adding extra behaviors to entire hierarchies of classes.

Motivation.
1. Need to define a new operation on an entire class hierarchy
   - E.g., make a document model printable to HTML/Markdown
2. Do not want to keep modifying every class in hierarchy
3. Need access to the non-common aspects of classes int the hierarchy
4. Create an external component to handle rendering
   - But avoid type checks
