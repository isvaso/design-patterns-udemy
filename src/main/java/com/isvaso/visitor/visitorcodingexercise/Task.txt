Visitor Coding Exercise
You are asked to implement a double-dispatch visitor called ExpressionPrinter
for printing different mathematical expressions.
The range of expressions covers addition and multiplication - please put round
brackets after around addition but not around multiplication!
Also, please avoid any blank spaces in output.

Example:
- Input: AdditionExpression(Value(2), Value(3))
- Output: (2+3)

Here is the corresponding unit test:

AdditionExpression simple = new AdditionExpression(new Value(2), new Value(3));
ExpressionPrinter ep = new ExpressionPrinter();
ep.visit(simple);
assertEquals("(2+3)", ep.toString());
