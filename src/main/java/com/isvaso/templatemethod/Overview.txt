Template Method.
Allows us ti define the 'skeleton' of the algorithm, with concrete
implementations defined in subclasses.

A high-level blueprint for an algorithm to be completed by inheritors.

Motivation.
1. Algorithms ca be decomposed inti common parts + specifics
2. Strategy pattern does this through composition
   - High-level algorithm uses an interface
   - Concrete implementations implement the interface
3. Template Method does the same thing through inheritance
   - Overall algorithm makes use of abstract member
   - Inheritors override the abstract members
   - Pattern template method invoked
