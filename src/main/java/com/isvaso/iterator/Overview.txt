Iterator.
An objects that facilitates the traversal of a data structure.

How traversal of data structures happens and who makes it happen.

Motivation.
1. Iteration (traversal) is a core functionality of various data structures;
2. An iterator is a class that facilities the traversal:
   - Keeps a reference to the current element
   - Knows how to move to a different element
3. Java has Iterator<T> and Iterable<T>
   - Iterator<T> specifies the iterator API
   - A class needs to be Iterable in order to support for (Foo foo : bar) loops
