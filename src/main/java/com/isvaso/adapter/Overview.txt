Adapter.
A construct which adapts and existing interface X to conform to th required interface Y.
Getting the interface you want from the interface you have.

Analogue from live:
1. Electrical devices have different power (interface) requirements:
   - Voltage (5V, 220V);
   - Socket/plug type (Europe, UK, USA)
2. We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
   - Some support possible (e.g., 120/220V)
3. Thus, we use a special device (an adapter), to give us the interface we require from interface we have.
